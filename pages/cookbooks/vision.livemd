# Computer Vision - Extracting Data from Images

```elixir
Mix.install(
  [
    {:instructor_lite, "~> 1.0"},
    {:req, "~> 0.5"},
    {:kino, "~> 0.12.3"}
  ]
)
```

## Motivation

In recent months, the latest AI research labs have turned LLMs into multimodal models. What this means is that they no longer just interpret text, but they can also interpret images. One example of this provided by Anthropic is the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. With no extra work, you can now provide images into your prompts with Instructor and still do the normal structured extractions that you're used to.

In the following example, we will extract product details from a screenshot of a Shopify store.

## Setup

In order to run code in this notebook, you need to add your Anthropic API key as an `ANTHROPIC_KEY` Livebook secret. It will then be accessible through an environment variable.

```elixir
secret_key = System.fetch_env!("LB_ANTHROPIC_KEY")
:ok
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
:ok
```

## Example

![](files/shopify-screenshot.png)

```elixir
image = Kino.FS.file_path("shopify-screenshot.png") |> File.read!()
base64_image = Base.encode64(image)

defmodule Product do
  use Ecto.Schema

  @primary_key false
  embedded_schema do
    field(:name, :string)
    field(:price, :decimal)
    field(:currency, Ecto.Enum, values: [:usd, :gbp, :eur, :cny])
    field(:color, :string)
  end
end

{:ok, result} =
  InstructorLite.instruct(%{
      messages: [
        %{
          role: "user",
          content: [
            %{type: "text", text: "What is the product details of the following image?"},
            %{type: "image", source: %{data: base64_image, type: "base64", media_type: "image/png"}}
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    adapter: InstructorLite.Adapters.Anthropic,
    response_model: Product,
    adapter_context: [api_key: secret_key]
  )

result
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
%Product{
  name: "Thomas Wooden Railway Thomas The Tank Engine",
  price: Decimal.new("33.0"),
  currency: :usd,
  color: "blue"
}
```
